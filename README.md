### Background and Inspiration

In this day and age, as generative AI models are the hottest talk, I decided to build a website that incorporated ChatGPT's functionality. However, let me get one thing straight, the UI of ChatGPT is _ugly_. Additionally, I brainstormed what I used ChatGPT the most for. Thus, my ideation process began, and then came the creation of Sumz.ai. Sumz.ai is a beautifully designed article-summarizing website that integrates the power of OpenAI's GPT-4 model to summarize any article link. All users have to do is enter the URL of their choice and, within a couple seconds, a descriptive summary is churned out.

### Details and Features

- Technologies used: JavaScript, React, Tailwind, Redux, Vite, OpenAI API, and RapidAPI.
- A built-in log of previously pasted URLs.
  - Able to copy these URLs to the user's clipboard.
  - Instantly go back to previous article summaries upon clicking these URLs.
  - Past URLs and article summaries are stored in database.
- A minimal yet beautiful UI design with gradient fonts.
- Had different screen sizes in mind. Is mobile-friendly.

### Notes

This was the first time I incorporated OpenAI's API to my own website. However, it definitely won't be the last time doing so. With GPTs being all the rage, I will use this build as a stepping stone to create more complex, diverse applications of generative AI usage. My goal is to build sites that will help users increase their productivity and find simplistic, more humanized approaches to using AI for their daily lives.
